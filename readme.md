## 3 Contributions Weâ€™d Like to See:
1. Incorporate periodic displays of encouraging quotes and messages to inspire the user to keep working hard!
2. User is given an option for a longer break if they've been working for a while.
3. Add animations to timer display depending on time left (ex: numbers flash when less than 30 seconds remain).
